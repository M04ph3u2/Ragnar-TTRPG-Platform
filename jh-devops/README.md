## Branch Overview: jh-devops

This branch contains the **DevOps infrastructure** and CI/CD pipeline configuration for the Ragnar TTRPG Platform, originally developed to support the deployment and operations of an innovative digital tabletop role-playing game solution. The infrastructure was designed to handle the scalable deployment requirements of what was intended to be a commercial platform serving hybrid online/offline gaming experiences.

**Project Evolution**: This DevOps infrastructure was built to support the original vision of creating a market-competitive TTRPG platform. When the project scope proved challenging to complete within available resources, the comprehensive automation and deployment systems were preserved as a demonstration of enterprise-level DevOps practices and cloud infrastructure management.

**DevOps Implementation**: This infrastructure was designed and implemented solely by **Stefano Sciacovelli** ([GitHub Profile](https://github.com/M04ph3u2)) as part of the platform's deployment automation requirements, showcasing advanced CI/CD pipeline orchestration and Azure cloud management capabilities.

## DevOps Architecture Overview

The DevOps infrastructure follows a **distributed microservices orchestration pattern** with the following components:

- **GitHub Actions Workflows**: Automated deployment, VM management, and backup orchestration
- **Multi-Repository Integration**: Cross-repository deployment triggers via repository dispatch
- **Azure Cloud Integration**: VM lifecycle management and resource orchestration
- **Automated Backup System**: Database and file system backup with retention policies
- **Environment Management**: Secure secrets management and environment configuration
