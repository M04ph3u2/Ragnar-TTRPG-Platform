## Project Description

~~The WebApp is associated with the HeatPeak Studio business website and is expected to include features such as an e-commerce platform and an innovative tool for playing a TTRPG (Tabletop Role-Playing Game). Currently, the project is in the early development stage, so there might be limited functionalities available.~~

---

## Repository Structure

The repository contains previous implementations of the project in React and NodeJS within the `legacy` folder. The current version is developed with Angular and Spring Boot. You will also find Dockerfiles ~~and a `compose` (for Docker Compose) folder to simplify server management and setup. The backend communicates with a PostgreSQL instance via Docker Compose on the same machine~~.

**Note: While the structure remains the same, the `compose` folder has been removed as it is no longer needed. The build is now hosted on onrender.com.**

---

## Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

~~The project implements CI/CD through an automated workflow defined in the YAML file located in the `.github/workflows` folder. This workflow streamlines the integration and deployment processes, ensuring a smooth and efficient development pipeline. Feel free to explore the workflow file for more insights into our CI/CD setup.~~

**Note: Although the workflow file still exists, it now simply builds the application and publishes it on Docker Hub, without any deployment.**
